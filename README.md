# Email Footers

## Usage

1. Look in `/examples` for the the footer you want (if you're in Product/Ops choose 'default'; if in Growth choose 'calendly').
2. Find its respective `***.html` file in `/templates`, Click Raw -> Copy all (CMD+A; CMD+C).
3. Go to `https://jsonformatter.org/html-viewer` in your browser.
4. Paste your clipboard in the left hand side.
5. Change the code on the left with your own details, e.g Louis Collar-Smith -> John Smith; Founder -> Design; calendly/louis-collar-smith -> calendly/john-smith.
6. Click Run.
7. Check the links work.
8. Copy inside the white part of the right hand side (the visualisation of the html). 
9. Paste your clipboard into your mail signatures section. In gmail you find your signatures by going Settings -> See all settings -> Signature -> Create new -> Paste your clipboard. If it looks weird it's because you didn't copy from inside the white part.
10. Please then send a test email to matt@quiver.co.uk and talha@quiver.co.uk with "Test Footer" as subject.

## Contribution

1. Only use HTML and CSS approved [here](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/). Writing HTML for emails is tricky because the majority of email clients don't support modern HTML and CSS!
2. Test it works as your own email footer before committing.
3. Upload and replace the screenshot in `/images`.
